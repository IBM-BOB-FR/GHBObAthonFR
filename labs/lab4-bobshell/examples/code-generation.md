## Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific in Descriptions

```bash
# Good: Specific and detailed
bob "Create a React component for a user profile card with avatar image, full name, email, bio text, and edit button. Include loading state, error handling, and responsive design for mobile and desktop." > UserProfile.jsx

# Less effective: Too vague
bob "Create a user profile component" > UserProfile.jsx
```

### 2. Specify Language and Framework

```bash
# Explicit language specification
bob "Create a user authentication function in Python" > auth.py

# Explicit framework specification
bob "Create a form component in React with TypeScript" > Form.tsx
```

### 3. Include Requirements

```bash
# Include all requirements
bob "Create an Express.js API endpoint for user registration with:
- Email and password validation
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT token generation
- Error handling for duplicate emails
- Input sanitization
- Rate limiting" > register.js
```

### 4. Request Documentation

```bash
# Request inline documentation
bob "Create a binary search function with detailed JSDoc comments explaining parameters, return value, and algorithm complexity" > binary-search.js

# Request examples
bob "Create a date formatting utility with usage examples in comments" > date-format.js
```

### 5. Specify Code Style

```bash
# Request specific style
bob "Create a React component following Airbnb style guide with functional components and hooks" > Component.jsx

# Request modern patterns
bob "Create an async function using modern ES2022 features like top-level await and optional chaining" > modern.js
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Generated code doesn't match expectations**
   - Be more specific in your description
   - Include examples of desired output
   - Specify the exact framework version

2. **Missing dependencies**
   - Request package.json or requirements.txt generation
   - Specify all required libraries in the prompt

3. **Code style inconsistencies**
   - Specify a style guide (Airbnb, Google, Standard)
   - Request linting configuration

4. **Incomplete implementations**
   - Break complex requests into smaller parts
   - Generate incrementally and combine

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Use Examples**: Include example input/output in your prompt
2. **Specify Versions**: Mention framework/library versions
# Request specific style
bob "Create a React component following Airbnb style guide with functional components and hooks" > Component.jsx

# Request modern patterns
bob "Create an async function using modern ES2022 features like top-level await and optional chaining" > modern.js
```

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Be Specific**: Include all requirements and constraints in your prompt
2. **Mention Language/Framework**: Explicitly state the technology you want
3. **Request Tests**: Ask for tests alongside code when needed
4. **Include Edge Cases**: Mention edge cases to handle
5. **Ask for Types**: Request TypeScript or type hints for better code quality
6. **Request Documentation**: Ask for inline comments and documentation
7. **Specify Error Handling**: Explicitly request error handling
8. **Mention Performance**: Ask for optimized implementations when needed
9. **Use Output Redirection**: Save generated code directly to files with `>`

## Example: Complete Generation Workflow

- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Middleware for protected routes
- Error handling
- Input validation
- Unit tests with Jest
Include detailed comments and follow best practices" > auth-system.js
```
