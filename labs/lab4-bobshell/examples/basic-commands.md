# BobShell Basic Commands Reference

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive reference for using BobShell with natural language prompts. Use these examples as a starting point for your own automation and workflows.

## Installation and Setup

### Install BobShell

**⚠️ Important for Windows Users:**

BobShell does not auto-install with Bob on Windows. You must install it separately by following the official installation guide:

👉 **[BobShell Installation Guide](https://internal.bob.ibm.com/docs/shell/install-and-setup)**

**For all users**, verify that BobShell is installed:

```bash
# Verify installation
bob --version
```

## Interactive Mode

### Starting Interactive Mode

```bash
# Start interactive session
bob
```

**Note:** Simply typing `bob` starts an interactive BobShell session. See the [BobShell Interactive Mode documentation](https://internal.bob.ibm.com/docs/shell/start-bobshell-interactive) for more details.

### Interactive Mode Examples

```
# General questions
> What is the difference between let and const in JavaScript?

# Code explanation
> Explain this code: function debounce(func, wait) { ... }

# Code generation
> Create a Python function to validate email addresses using regex

# Code review
> Review this function for potential issues: [paste code]

# Refactoring suggestions
> How can I improve this code: [paste code]

# Exit interactive mode
> exit
> quit
> :q

### Using Checkpoints

Checkpoints allow you to save and restore conversation state in interactive mode. Enable checkpointing when starting Bob:

```bash
# Start Bob with checkpointing enabled
bob --checkpointing
```

Or enable it in Bob settings, then start normally with `bob`.

**How to Use Checkpoints:**

Once enabled, Bob automatically saves conversation states. You can naturally reference earlier points:

```
# Work on your code
> Analyze this code for issues
# Bob provides analysis

> Suggest fixes for the issues
# Bob suggests fixes

> Actually, let's go back to the analysis and try a different approach
# Bob restores to the analysis state

> Instead of fixing, suggest a complete refactor
# Bob provides refactoring suggestions
```

**Checkpoint Use Cases:**
- Experiment with different approaches
- Try multiple solution paths
- Return to earlier conversation states
- Explore alternatives without losing progress

```

## Non-Interactive Mode (Natural Language Prompts)

    bob "Analyze $file for code quality issues" >> analysis-results.txt
done

# Review all Python files
for file in ./src/**/*.py; do
    bob "Review $file for code quality and best practices in markdown format" > "reviews/$(basename $file).md"
done

# Generate tests for all files
bob test-generate ./src/**/*.js --output-dir ./tests

# Refactor all files in directory
bob "Refactor all files in ./src directory recursively using modern coding patterns and best practices"
```

## Output Formats

### Available Formats

```bash
# JSON output (for programmatic processing)
bob analyze ./src --format json

# Markdown output (for documentation)
bob review ./src --format markdown

# HTML output (for reports)
bob security-scan ./src --format html

# Plain text output (default)
bob explain ./src/app.js --format text

# YAML output
bob analyze ./src --format yaml
```

## Configuration Management

### Managing Configuration

```bash
# View current configuration
bob config list

# Get specific config value
bob config get api-key
bob config get default-mode

# Set configuration value
bob config set cache-ttl 3600
bob config set max-tokens 4096

# Reset configuration
bob config reset

# Review all Python files
for file in ./src/**/*.py; do
    bob "Review $file and suggest improvements" >> review-results.md
done
```

## Piping and Chaining

### Combining Commands

```bash
# Pipe code to Bob for explanation
cat ./src/app.js | bob "Explain this code"

# Chain with other tools
bob "Analyze ./src for quality issues and output as JSON" | jq '.issues[] | select(.severity == "high")'

# Use in scripts
if bob "Scan ./src for critical security vulnerabilities" | grep -q "CRITICAL"; then
    echo "Security issues found"
    exit 1
else
    echo "Security check passed"
fi

# Combine multiple Bob commands
bob "Analyze ./src for code quality" > analysis.json && \
bob "Review ./src for best practices" > review.md && \
bob "Scan ./src for security vulnerabilities" > security.html
```

## Tips and Tricks

### Productivity Tips

1. **Use Aliases**: Create shell aliases for common prompts
   ```bash
   alias bob-review='bob "Review my code changes for quality and best practices"'
   alias bob-scan='bob "Scan for high and critical security vulnerabilities"'
   ```

2. **Save Common Prompts**: Store frequently used prompts in files
   ```bash
   echo "Analyze this code for quality, performance, and security issues" > analyze-prompt.txt
   bob "$(cat analyze-prompt.txt) in ./src/app.js"
   ```

3. **Use Variables in Scripts**: Make prompts reusable
   ```bash
   FILE="./src/app.js"
   bob "Analyze $FILE for code quality and suggest improvements"
   ```

4. **Combine with Git**: Integrate Bob into your git workflow
   ```bash
   # .git/hooks/pre-commit
   #!/bin/bash
   bob "Review my uncommitted changes and check for issues" | grep -q "ERROR" && exit 1
   ```

## Common Patterns

### Useful Workflow Patterns

```bash
# Quick code review workflow
bob "Review my uncommitted changes" && \
bob "Scan for security vulnerabilities" && \
npm test

# Documentation update workflow
bob "Generate API documentation for ./src" > docs/api.md && \
bob "Create a comprehensive README for this project" > README.md

# Pre-deployment checks
bob "Analyze ./src and ensure code quality score is above 80" && \
bob "Scan for critical security vulnerabilities" && \
npm run test

# Code quality improvement workflow
bob "Analyze ./src for quality issues" > before-analysis.txt && \
bob "Refactor ./src to use modern best practices" && \
bob "Analyze ./src for quality issues" > after-analysis.txt
```
